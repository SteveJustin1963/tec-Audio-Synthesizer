PIM(Pulse Interleaving Method):

1. Use a high frequency to switch between high and low states.
2. Keep the speaker cone in one or more in-between states.
3. Represent a complex sine wave summation as a "stepped" rectangular wave.
4. Achieve polyphony.


// expand the above into each algorithm

1. Use a high frequency to switch between high and low states:

-Set a high frequency to switch between high and low states.
-Keep the speaker cone in one or more in-between states.
-Represent a complex sine wave summation as a "stepped" rectangular wave.
-Achieve polyphony.

2. Keep the speaker cone in one or more in-between states:

-Set a high frequency to switch between high and low states.
-Keep the speaker cone in one or more in-between states.
-Represent a complex sine wave summation as a "stepped" rectangular wave.
-Achieve polyphony.

3. Represent a complex sine wave summation as a "stepped" rectangular wave:

-Set a high frequency to switch between high and low states.
-Keep the speaker cone in one or more in-between states.
-Represent a complex sine wave summation as a "stepped" rectangular wave.
-Achieve polyphony.

4. Achieve polyphony:

-Set a high frequency to switch between high and low states.
-Keep the speaker cone in one or more in-between states.
-Represent a complex sine wave summation as a "stepped" rectangular wave.
-Achieve polyphony.
